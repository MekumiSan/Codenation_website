    <h3>What I do</h3>

    <p>Another point of view is a fledgling model making company utilising over twenty years of fabrication knowledge and experience in the model making industry.

        We aim to provide creative solutions to bespoke projects- large or small- for clients across all disciplines. In other words, we can create almost anything! </p>
        <h3>Why I do it</h3>
        <img src= "handmade.jpg"alt="handmade"class="imm_size">  
        <p>At a time in which VR and digital renderings are easily accessible, a model may seem obsolete. However, we believe that a high quality physical item still has its place, and can really help in selling an idea and provoking interest in a product. People are still attracted to the tactile nature of a physical scale model, and we pride ourselves on delivering high quality work that will stand the test of time.</p> 
        <h3>Bespoke to fit any budget</h3>
        <img src= "citta2.jpg"alt="village"class="imm_size">
